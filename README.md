## About
Frog Puzzle is a recreation of one of my favourite games called *Frog Puzzle, Logic Puzzles & Brain Training*. It is a cute and puzzle-based game that allows users to define the direction the frog will hop on to in order to reach the end rock, after it has landed on all rocks and does not fall into water.  </br>
